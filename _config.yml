# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

title: Interstellar short sf reviews
author:

description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  I do reviews of science fiction short stories.
  From new issues of magazines, older magazines, anthologies, collections and single stories.
  I just write my honest opinions as a regular fan of the genre and hope to get more people interested in reading short fiction.
