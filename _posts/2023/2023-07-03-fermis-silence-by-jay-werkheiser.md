As the title shows this is a short story dealing with a possible explenation for the famous Fermi's Paradox.

The story switches between two viewpoints both asking the same question. Why haven't we detected alien life yet? One is human and the other is likely some silicium based life form. They both go back and forth with all their various data readings and observations, and unsurprisingly are only looking for life signs like themselves thus missing the others.

The story is only four pages and sort of amusing, but its point is fairly obvious and unoriginal from the start, so there isn't much more to the story than that.
