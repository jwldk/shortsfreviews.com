This 10 year old story was quite fun to read today, because we aren't far from the "app"-controlled future depicted here. When smartphones were new, the phrase "there is an app for that" quickly became popular. This story presents a near future where there is an app in practically everything, which isn't far off from all the IoT devices we have today.

A man has his life controlled by various smart apps as he tries to loose weight hoping it will impress his new girlfriend. His fridge controls what he eats and his shoes how long he runs.

There isn't exactly any hidden message here as the story is fairly straightforward about how we should make our own decisions in life. Should we satisfy the apps or the people we care about? A pretty good story that barely feels like science fiction here in 2023.
