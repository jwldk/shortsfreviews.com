This story dives into the multiple worlds theory and quantum mechanics, but its flavor is more of a personal drama than theoretical physics speculation.
We follow a physicists trying to test his theory while dealing with his less than enthusiastic students, but it is his tragic past that in an unexpected manner that end up moving him forward.

This well written story got me hooked very quickly.
I was impressed with how quickly we get to understand, and feel, where the main character Sebastian is in his professional and personal life.
His past gets naturally and gradually revealed, and the narrative is engaging even though it isn't a story filled with conflict or drama.

The multiple worlds theory has been explored countless times in science fiction, and the scope of these types of stories can get quite wide, but Frank Ward keeps in close and personal which I really appreciated.
