As the title suggests, this is a bit of a different take on the first contact story.
We follow three astronauts on tenth mission to Jupiter's largest moon Ganymede.
Previous missions have found fossil lifeforms and established a base on the moon.

The three astronauts make some new groundbreaking discovery on the alien life on Ganymede, but simultaneously a galactic storm hits the solar system (sort of like a big solar flare with radiation) that wreaks havoc.

What hooked me with this story wasn't the plot, and it almost takes a backseat, but the whole atmosphere, the characters and the world building around everything.
Things aren't overly explained, but we get a sense of how these astronauts have a certain "honor"-culture the abide by, which influences their choices.
It is a rare thing to read a science fiction story that not only imagines a different technological future, but also how people might be different.
