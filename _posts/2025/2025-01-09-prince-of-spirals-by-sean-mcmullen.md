McMullen is always worth reading in my opinion and this entertaining story builds up a very unique premise that I haven't seen in science fiction, dealing with DNA archaeology and an unresolved mystery involving [the Plantagenets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Plantagenet).

Dr. Angelo Maslini becomes the unfortunate victim of a kidnapping by a group people who claim to ascendants of the Plantagenets, and they want to secure proof of that.
Problem is that the bones of the sons of Edward IV is lying in a tomb in Westminster Abbey.
They enter the tomb with a remote controlled robot and have it bring back samples for Angelo to analyze.

That is pretty much the story, and it is filled with interesting tidbits about DNA analysis and small historic lessons.
I am sure readers interested in that mystery of what really happened to the two sons will have a great time with this story, though even without it I had a pretty good time reading this entertaining story.
Sean McMullen keeps the pace consistent throughout with some cool twists and reveals along the way.
