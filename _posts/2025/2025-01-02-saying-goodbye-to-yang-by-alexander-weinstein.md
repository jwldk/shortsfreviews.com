I watched the film _After Yang_ from 2021 directed by Kogonada and I liked the general premise of the story, though I did home issues with the film.
This story from 2010 is what the film is based on and served as a great introduction to this unknown to me author.

Set in a near future where both clones and androids exists, though there seems to be an undertone of a form of racism and conflict between people using those two forms of artificial humans.
The story follows a normal family who has an adopted girl and the android Yang who functions as a sort of big brother.
One day Yang breaks down and the father is desperate for getting it repaired, but Yang is out of warranty.

This story is more about the premise and background worldbuilding than the actual plot.
The backdrop with a future society with new forms of prejudice was nicely done and parallels to present day issues are easy to draw.
The film adaption adds extra elements that works both to its detriment and benefit, but this short story definitely made me want to read other stories by Weinstein.
