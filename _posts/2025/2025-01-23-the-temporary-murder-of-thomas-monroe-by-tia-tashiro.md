This techno-murder-mystery-thriller hits the ground running with a cool premise of a young man being reawakened after his murder, and the story basically unravels his memory loss of what lead to that event.

We establish from the first paragraphs that Jay is the murderer and Thomas is the victim.
Thomas has rich parents so he can be revived with fancy technology.
The story works its way backwards so we gradually get to learn about both Jay and Thomas, and how they are connected.

Besides a just generally well structured thriller reveal plot type story, I found Thomas' story to be both compelling and tragic.
We learn about how his parents misguided ambitions for him robs him of personal freedom and relationships.

The truth about the murder is an interesting turn of events and I think it could make a pretty good movie.
