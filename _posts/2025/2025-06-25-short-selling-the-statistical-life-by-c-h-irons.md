The concept of putting a price tag on a human life is an uncomfortable thought, but it is a thing that exists for statistical purposes.
From my understanding mostly to help with cost/benefit analysis on for example construction work that will increase road safety.
In this story the statistical life value is a bit more sinister, as it is a traded commodity on the stock market, and thus subject to manipulation and short selling.

The story follows a healthcare worker who is contacted by mysterious people that claim to have a way to predictable predict future developments of the stock market evaluation of the statistical life index.
They use that information to "short" the index and use the money to help underfunded hospitals.
In their own words, they take advantage of the horrible market manipulation system to do some good instead.
Our protagonist is sceptical at first to be in on this scheme, but goes through it with it.

This basic plot is mostly there to serve the world building for this dystopic future where the statistical life index is used to suppress workers.
While I do like the idea behind this premise, I think it is less successful as a story.
We don't really get a proper understanding of what this statistical life concept does to regular people or society in general, only that the healthcare sector is underfunded, but you don't need a science fiction story to write about that issue.
I also miss some sort of more detailed explanation of why the index would go up or down.
I can accept the vague reasons for why they have a solid way of predicting future market fluctuations, but there still need a real world event or reason to give perspective to why the index should suddenly crash hard.
In that sense, the story come up short.
