I guess most people who have any interest in time travel have thought about what they would do if they were thrown back in time with the knowledge they had. In this quirky and fun time travel story, four people are by accident transported back to 1970s and they deal with that opportunity in different ways.

The focus is mostly on Ruth who with some knowledge of a prominent Hockey game is able to gamble herself to a lot of money and she uses the capital to gain influence over the Star Trek like tv series she was involved in at the time. Roles and themes gets a major change, which doesn't please the star of the show - Wallace, who also has been transported to the past.

The story is a mix of fun clichés and satire on gender roles and science fiction tv shows. Great entertainment with well rounded characters.
