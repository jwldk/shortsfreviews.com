Stories about machines that are programmed to protect humans against ourselves goes far.
Reading this humorous little story I was reminded of "With Folded Hands" by Jack Williamson from 1947, but this isn't nearly as sinister.

Dyna has fitted her condo with an AI program of sorts, called LuvHome, and it has been configured to improve her life and given authority to do so with any means necessary.
The story starts where it has locked her out of her apartment in what it says is her own best interest:

> “Already spelled it out, nice and proper in the paperwork you signed when you bought me. But to get more specific, you need to get out and meet people. Eat food that’s good for you. And get some exercise. You’ve done yourself no good by lying around all day doing nothing but eating junk. That’s all you’ve done ever since moving in. I’ve had a chat with the places that deliver your takeout meals, and they’ve agreed to ignore your future orders. I’ve told them what to send instead.”

Dyna is furious and goes to the police who can't help her because she bought and agreed to the LuvHome installation.
So she is forced to actually be outside for a bit and meet new people, and that is pretty much the story.

It is very straight forward with its setup and conclusion, all told in a screwball like comedy tone.
I was actually a bit surprised that the point of the message wasn't, at least not obviously, a critique of machines controlling our lives.
More like the opposite as LuvHome is shown to basically be right in forcing her to go outside.

Neat little story that will put a smile on most peoples faces.
