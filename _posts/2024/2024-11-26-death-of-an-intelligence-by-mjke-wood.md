In a couple hundred years artificial intelligences have created an utopia without crime or suffering.
But what do you do when a murder on an AI happens and there is no such thing as police investigators?
You hire a history professor who has studied ancient detective novels.

The story follows professor Petri and Alyssa in their investigation into a mysterious sabotage of an artificial intelligence.
Or just "intelligence" as the term "artificial" is considered rude at this point.
Apparently somebody messed with the cooling system and there are only three potential suspects.

The structure is the classic detective procedural where the professor seemingly have solved the case almost immediately, but now must go through the usual motions for the sake of the apprentice - and the reader.
For what it is, I think it is fairly well written and slightly amusing, with some interesting tidbits here and there giving a hint on what sort of future we are in here.
