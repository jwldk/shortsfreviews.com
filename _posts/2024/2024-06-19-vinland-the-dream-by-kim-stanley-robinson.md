While Kim Stanley Robinson is mostly known for his great novels, he has written some interesting short stories.
They are often a bit unusual in that they more work like small vignettes with some philosophical musings.
His novella *Green Mars* (not related to the novel with the same title) is almost poetic.
This little stories explores some interesting ideas on the nature of history.

The short story is structured like a scientific paper with sections named "Abstract", "Introduction", "Experimental Methods", "Discussion", "Conclusions" and "Acknowledgements".
A professor in archaeology is finding evidence that the historical version of the vikings discovering [Vinland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinland) might be a very elaborate hoax.
This concerns him greatly given that history as he knows it, will have to be rewritten.

However, his companion has a great quote that beautifully sums up the essence of this story:

> "History is made of stories people tell. And fictions, dreams, hoaxes - they also are made of stories people tell. True or false, itâ€™s the stories that matter to us. Certain qualities in the stories themselves make them true or false."
>
> p. 224

It is not a story with much drama or plot, but it does make for a thoughtful pleasant reading that I would recommend to anyone who appreciates Robinson's writing style.
