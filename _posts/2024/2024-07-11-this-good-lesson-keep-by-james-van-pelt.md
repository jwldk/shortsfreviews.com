This story is set in a near future school where various electronic devices have taken over the classroom and the students.
A teacher on her last year before retirement plans for her class to read and perform Shakespeare's *Hamlet*.

The teaching of *Hamlet* is the binding narrative, but it was everything else going on that I found noteworthy in this story.
It focuses on two students, where one is a boy with very religious parents.
He has some eye implants that adds an overlay to everything he sees, to basically show him a "christian" version of the world.
Like it will show good people as angels and whomever it decides to be bad people as devils.
Things get complicated when he fancies a girl in class, whom his parents don't approve of.

The whole concept of editorialising the physical world like that is frightening and I kind of wished van Pelt unpacked this more, but what stands is a very touching and positive story on the powers of good teaching that goes beyond technology.
