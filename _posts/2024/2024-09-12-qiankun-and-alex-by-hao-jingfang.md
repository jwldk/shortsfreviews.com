This story translated from Chinese by Xueting Christine Ni is a bit similar to [Machine Learning](https://shortsfreviews.com/2024/09/08/machine-learning-by-nancy-kress/) with a small story about an AI that learns about humans through interaction with children.

The AI is sort of a functioning babysitter for Alex as he plays around the house, chasing the cleaning robot or interacting with screens.
The AI is observing and noting many things as incomprehensible with how the kid's behaviour isn't exactly logical.
But the AI actually manages to learn something new from this and forms it's own insight and motivation.

This is a cute little story with a positive upbeat feeling. It may not be super deep or groundbreaking, but just a sweet little story about the childlike joy of learning about the world.
