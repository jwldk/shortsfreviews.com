_Clarkesworld_ have published a lot of translated Chinese stories in recent years. Many of them have dealt with death in different ways and this does too. Translated by Jay Zhang.

About 50 years in the future a technology exists that allows people to have their whole life recorded by a small flying drone resembling a hummingbird. The story is told by a mother who has lost her daughter to cancer at a young age. She ponders whether she should use the recordings of her daughters life to make a simulated recreation of her.

This a story that isn't focused on plot and the structure is not straightforward with various diary like entries from the past, the mother that her addresses her deceased daughter in second person about her life, and the process of creating the simulation. None of the science fiction ideas presented here are exactly new, but they don't need to be, because it is presented in such a way that I found emotionally engaging in a way I rarely get with these kind of "recreating the dead" type of stories. Even though the subject is tragic, it is not a sad story per se and it doesn't become sentimental. There is a lot of celebration of the life lived by this woman and how her mother have conflicted thoughts about recording technology. In addition, even though it is a very character focused story - we also get a sense of an interesting complex future through various worldbuilding hints.

It is great to see how _Clarkesworld_ continues to bring translated works of science fiction to a wider readership and this is one of the highly recommended ones.
